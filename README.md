### Why work with us?

An innovative construction services provider for more than half a century, EllisDon has developed building solutions for nearly every construction challenge imaginable. Drawing on our core values of trust, accountability and openness, our specialties span a wide variety of projects for a diverse group of clients. For EllisDon, itâ€™s not about having all the right answers, but about asking the right questions.

This unique way of thinking not only instills a sense of autonomy in our project teams, but it creates a desire to find new solutions on each and every project. Our Virtual Construction division was created because someone asked the question: What if we could use technology to help the consultant, client, contractor and sub-contractors all speak the same language?

The result? A team of industry-experts that provide value-added service and previously-inaccessible information through technology like 3D Laser Scanning.

### Adapting to the needs of the industry

As-built records are the starting point of every restoration and refurbishment. Accurate information on existing building conditions through up-to-date records forms the basis of design; this is especially true on both ICI construction and civil projects.

The way we see it, accurate record documentation from day one is a key ingredient when it comes to successful project planning and risk mitigation. If the design relies on incomplete or inaccurate information, issues are engrained in the project documentation. As the project grows, these issues become more complex and make a bigger impact on the overall success of the project.

The solution? Create a dedicated 3D Laser Scanning Division within EllisDon. This service is yet another value-add accompanying our Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Virtual Construction expertise.

## Our Process

### How does it make a difference

Laser Scanning is revolutionizing traditional surveying methods and practices. Multiple scans from the site are collected and fused together to produce one, complete survey. In just three minutes, each scan captures one-million points of data per second in all directions.

What does this mean to you? Site surveying time and the need for additional visits is reduced dramatically. Additionally, planning software developed by our in-house team of experts further increases surveying efficiency in the field.
