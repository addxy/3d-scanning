### Why work with us?

An innovative construction services provider for more than half a century, EllisDon has developed building solutions for nearly every construction challenge imaginable. Drawing on our core values of trust, accountability and openness, our specialties span a wide variety of projects for a diverse group of clients. For EllisDon, it’s not about having all the right answers, but about asking the right questions.

This unique way of thinking not only instills a sense of autonomy in our project teams, but it creates a desire to find new solutions on each and every project. Our Virtual Construction division was created because someone asked the question: What if we could use technology to help the consultant, client, contractor and sub-contractors all speak the same language?

The result? A team of industry-experts that provide value-added service and previously-inaccessible information through technology like 3D Laser Scanning.

### Adapting to the needs of the industry

As-built records are the starting point of every restoration and refurbishment. Accurate information on existing building conditions through up-to-date records forms the basis of design; this is especially true on both ICI construction and civil projects.

The way we see it, accurate record documentation from day one is a key ingredient when it comes to successful project planning and risk mitigation. If the design relies on incomplete or inaccurate information, issues are engrained in the project documentation. As the project grows, these issues become more complex and make a bigger impact on the overall success of the project.

The solution? Create a dedicated 3D Laser Scanning Division within EllisDon. This service is yet another value-add accompanying our Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Virtual Construction expertise.

## Our Process

### How does it make a difference

Laser Scanning is revolutionizing traditional surveying methods and practices. Multiple scans from the site are collected and fused together to produce one, complete survey. In just three minutes, each scan captures one-million points of data per second in all directions.

What does this mean to you? Site surveying time and the need for additional visits is reduced dramatically. Additionally, planning software developed by our in-house team of experts further increases surveying efficiency in the field.

## Through this innovative technology

### We are able to provide:

![Time](blank)
More **TIME** to solve bigger problems.

The entire site can be captured in just one site visit.

![Accuracy](blank)
More **ACCURACY** in the models.

Our Laser Scanners are accurate to +/– 2mm over 25m.

![Money](blank)
More **MONEY** saved.

We can capture more data with less surveys, which means less cost for the owner.

![Friendly](blank)
More **USER FRIENDLY**.

The Point Clouds created are transferable to CAD and BIM software applications.

![Accessibility](blank)
More **ACCESSIBILITY** for Clients.

All data is viewable and measurable on our online server application. No secret password or engineering degree needed to decipher what they say.


## Scanshare
### ANYTIME, ANYWHERE.

An online viewing application (similar to Google Street View™), Scanshare allows the user to view and measure 360° images from every scanner location (effectively viewing the site remotely). The application facilitates multi-discipline collaboration between project participants minimizing the necessity for site visits.

## OUR SERVICES DEFINED BY YOU

Each of our services is tailored to suit the unique needs of each individual project.

### PRODUCING AS-BUILTS

We scan existing buildings to produce a point cloud survey which can be used as a basis to start design work, or simply to have accurate information for facilities management. These scans can then be brought into 2D AutoCad, 3D B IM software or simply stored online for easy access and collaboration. We can also maintain the accuracy of this as-built into the future.

### CONSTRUCTION QA/QC

When it comes to quality control, you couldn’t ask for more options than are available through laser scanning. Through the use of this leading-edge technology, our team is able to scan: site topography to develop earthworks quantities; concrete pours to measure floor flatness; and building systems to verify their installation tolerance and accuracy. These 3D scans can be configured and layered on top of each other, making it easier to review against consultant and sub-contractor 3D models and identify potential issues.

### CONSTRUCTION RECORDS

Site photography will only go so far; using Scanshare, we can scan at strategic points during construction to collect records. This captures the exact location and geometry of concealed systems, providing both a time and measureable 3D colour record.

### DISASTER RECOVERY

Working with insurance adjusters to capture the geometry of disaster sites, our team has the ability to collect data from difficult-to-access or dangerous environments.

### ACCURATE AS-BUILT DATA ON DEMAND:

From our perspective accurate as-built documentation is imperative for successful design development, coordination and mitigation of risk. We understand the difficulties in maintaining an accurate set of record drawings of a facility with refurbishment cycles, general maintenance and repair. We have developed a 3D as-built maintenance service four our clients who wish to have an accurate as-built model of their building for facility or property management purposes.
